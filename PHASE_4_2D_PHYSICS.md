### Integration Strategy
- Extend existing PhysicsWorld to support both 2D and 3D physics
- Use composition pattern to include PhysicsWorld2D within PhysicsWorld
- Maintain separate update loops for 2D and 3D physics
- Share physics materials between 2D and 3D systems

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: 2D Math Foundation
- ✅ Vector2 already exists
- Create 2D-specific math utilities (rotation, transforms)

### Step 2: 2D Collider System
- Implement base Collider2D class
- Create CircleCollider2D, BoxCollider2D, PolygonCollider2D
- Implement 2D collision detection algorithms (SAT, GJK for 2D)

### Step 3: 2D Rigid Body System
- Create RigidBody2D with 2D position, velocity, angular velocity
- Implement 2D force application and integration
- Add 2D-specific constraints (freeze X/Y position, freeze rotation)

### Step 4: 2D Spatial Partitioning
- Implement QuadTree for efficient 2D broad-phase collision detection
- Optimize for 2D spatial queries and updates

### Step 5: 2D Physics World
- Create PhysicsWorld2D manager
- Integrate with existing PhysicsWorld
- Implement 2D-specific gravity and physics simulation

### Step 6: Testing and Integration
