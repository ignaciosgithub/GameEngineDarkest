# Phase 3: Enhanced Physics System - GameEngineDarkest

## Overview
Implementing Unity-comparable 3D and 2D physics with deterministic rollback capabilities for networking support.

## Current Physics System Analysis

### Existing Components
- **PhysicsWorld**: Basic physics simulation with fixed timestep (60 FPS)
- **RigidBody**: Position, velocity, forces, basic material properties
- **CollisionDetection**: Sphere-sphere, box-box, sphere-box collision detection

### Limitations Identified
- O(n²) brute force collision detection (no spatial partitioning)
- Only 3D physics (no 2D support)
- Limited collider shapes (sphere, box, plane only)
- No deterministic rollback for networking
- Empty collision resolution placeholder
- No joints/constraints system
- No continuous collision detection for fast objects

## Enhancement Plan

### 3D Physics Enhancements
1. **Spatial Partitioning**: Implement octree for broad-phase collision detection
2. **Advanced Colliders**: Add capsule, mesh, convex hull colliders
3. **Continuous Collision Detection**: Handle fast-moving objects
4. **Improved Integration**: Better numerical integration methods
5. **Joints & Constraints**: Implement common joint types
6. **Physics Materials**: Enhanced friction, restitution, density

### 2D Physics System
1. **2D Physics World**: Separate 2D physics simulation
2. **2D Colliders**: Circle, box, polygon, edge colliders
3. **2D Joints**: Distance, revolute, prismatic joints
4. **2D Spatial Partitioning**: Quadtree for 2D broad-phase

### Deterministic Rollback
1. **State Serialization**: Serialize/deserialize physics state
2. **Fixed-Point Math**: Deterministic floating-point operations
3. **Rollback Manager**: Handle state rollback and replay
4. **Input Buffering**: Buffer inputs for rollback scenarios
