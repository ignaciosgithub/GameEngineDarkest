# Phase 2: Advanced Rendering System

## Overview
Implementing advanced rendering features comparable to Unity's HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline) including deferred rendering, forward rendering, post-processing effects, and modern graphics techniques.

## Architecture Goals
- **Deferred Rendering Pipeline**: G-buffer based rendering for complex lighting
- **Forward Rendering Pipeline**: Traditional forward rendering for transparency and special effects  
- **Post-Processing Stack**: HDR, tone mapping, bloom, SSAO, anti-aliasing
- **Material System**: PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials
- **Lighting System**: Point, directional, spot lights with shadows
- **Shader Management**: Modern GLSL shader compilation and management

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Renderer**: Abstract base class with OpenGLRenderer implementation
- **Shader System**: Basic class structure but no actual compilation
- **Mesh System**: Placeholder implementations (empty Upload/Bind/Draw)
- **OpenGL Usage**: Deprecated immediate mode (glBegin/glEnd)
- **Integration**: Engine renders 5x5 cube grid through hardcoded geometry

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Outdated OpenGL**: Uses deprecated immediate mode instead of modern buffer objects
2. **Missing Core Features**: No VBO/VAO/EBO, framebuffers, or render targets
3. **Placeholder Implementations**: Mesh and shader systems need complete rewrite
4. **No Modern Pipeline**: Lacks support for deferred/forward rendering architectures

G-Buffer 1 (RGBA8): Normal (RG) + Roughness (B) + AO (A) 
G-Buffer 2 (RGBA16F): World Position (RGB) + Depth (A)
G-Buffer 3 (RGBA8): Motion Vectors (RG) + Material ID (B) + Flags (A)
```

### Shader Variants
- Forward/Deferred rendering paths
- Shadow receiving/casting variants
