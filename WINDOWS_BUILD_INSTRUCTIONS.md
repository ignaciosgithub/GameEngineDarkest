# Windows Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
1. **Visual Studio 2022** (Community Edition or higher)
   - Install with "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - Ensure Windows 10/11 SDK is included

2. **Git for Windows**
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

3. **vcpkg** (C++ Package Manager)
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   .\vcpkg integrate install
   ```

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- DirectX 11 compatible graphics card
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- 2GB free disk space

## Build Steps

### 1. Clone Repository
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ignaciosgithub/GameEngineDarkest.git
cd GameEngineDarkest
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
The project uses vcpkg for dependency management. Dependencies will be automatically installed during CMake configuration.

Required packages (automatically handled):
- OpenGL
- GLFW3
- GLEW
- GLM

### 3. Generate Visual Studio Solution
```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path-to-vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Replace `[path-to-vcpkg]` with your actual vcpkg installation path.

### 4. Build the Project
Option A - Command Line:
```cmd
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Option B - Visual Studio:
1. Open `GameEngineDarkest.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Set build configuration to "Release"
3. Build â†’ Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

### 5. Run the Demo
```cmd
cd demo
.\GameEngineDemo.exe
```

## Controls
- **WASD**: Move camera
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **1-5**: Switch between rendering pipeline test scenes
- **ESC**: Exit application

## Features Demonstrated
- 3D navigation with WASD controls
- Multiple rendering pipelines (Deferred, Forward, Raytracing)
- 3D physics simulation with collision detection
- 2D physics system with rigid body dynamics
- Spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CMake Configuration Fails**
- Ensure vcpkg path is correct in the cmake command
- Verify Visual Studio 2022 is installed with C++ workload

**Build Errors**
- Check that Windows SDK is installed
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed via vcpkg

**Runtime Errors**
- Verify graphics drivers are up to date
- Ensure DirectX 11 is available on the system

**Performance Issues**
- Switch to Release build configuration
- Update graphics drivers
- Close unnecessary background applications

### Debug Build
For development, use Debug configuration:
```cmd
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

## Architecture Overview
The engine follows a modular ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture:

- **Core**: ECS framework, math library, platform abstraction
- **Rendering**: OpenGL renderer with multiple pipeline support
- **Physics**: 3D and 2D physics systems with spatial partitioning
- **UI**: Engine interface (temporarily disabled)

## Next Steps
After successful build and testing:
1. Explore the demo scenes using number keys 1-5
2. Test WASD navigation and mouse look
3. Observe physics simulation in action
4. Review the modular architecture for expansion
